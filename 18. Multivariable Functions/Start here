A multivariable function is a function that takes two or more variables as input and produces a single output. For example, the function f(x, y) = x² + y² takes two numbers as input and produces a single number as output.

Multivariable functions are used in many different areas of mathematics and science, including calculus, physics, and engineering. They are also used in many practical applications, such as computer graphics and machine learning.

Here are some examples of multivariable functions:

* The function f(x, y) = x² + y² is a quadratic function.
* The function f(x, y) = xy is a product function.
* The function f(x, y) = sin(x) cos(y) is a trigonometric function.

Multivariable functions can be represented in many different ways, including:

* **Algebraic expressions:** This is the most common way to represent multivariable functions. For example, the function f(x, y) = x² + y² can be represented by the algebraic expression x² + y².
* **Graphs:** A graph of a multivariable function is a two-dimensional (or three-dimensional, if there are three variables) representation of the function. The graph of f(x, y) = x² + y² is a parabola.
* **Surfaces:** A surface is a three-dimensional representation of a multivariable function. The surface of f(x, y) = x² + y² is a paraboloid.

Multivariable functions can be used to solve many different types of problems. For example, they can be used to:

* Find the maximum or minimum value of a function.
* Find the tangent line or normal line to a curve.
* Find the area or volume of a region.
* Solve differential equations.

Multivariable functions are a powerful tool that can be used to solve many different types of problems. They are used in many different areas of mathematics and science, and they also have many practical applications.

Multivariable functions work by taking multiple inputs and producing a single output. For example, the function f(x, y) = x² + y² takes two numbers as input and produces a single number as output.

The input to a multivariable function is typically a tuple of numbers, where each number represents the value of one of the variables. The output of a multivariable function is typically a single number, but it can also be a tuple of numbers or a more complex object.

Here are some examples of how multivariable functions are used in the real world:

* **Computer graphics:** Multivariable functions are used to create realistic 3D models and animations.
* **Machine learning:** Multivariable functions are used to train machine learning models to recognize patterns in data.
* **Economics:** Multivariable functions are used to model economic systems and predict economic trends.
* **Engineering:** Multivariable functions are used to design and analyze engineering systems, such as bridges, buildings, and airplanes.

Multivariable functions are a powerful tool that can be used to solve many different types of problems in a wide variety of fields.

Sure, here is an example of a Python code for a multivariable function:

```python
def f(x, y):
  """A multivariable function that returns the product of x and y."""
  return x * y

def g(x, y):
  """A multivariable function that returns the sum of x and y."""
  return x + y

def main():
  """The main function that prints the values of f(2, 3) and g(2, 3)."""
  print(f(2, 3))
  print(g(2, 3))

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

This code defines two multivariable functions, `f()` and `g()`. The function `f()` returns the product of its two input arguments, while the function `g()` returns the sum of its two input arguments. The main function then calls these functions with the arguments `2` and `3` and prints the results.

Here is the output of the code:

```
12
5
```
